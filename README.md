This project is the first time in the program where I've been stumped.
I struggled with using FS so I decided to used localStorage. My code would've been cleaner if I used FS and I could find tutorials on how to build a RESTful Task Tracker App, but I won't be able to explain my code. 
This is my first time using localStorage and I had to do extensive research on the method but I definitely understand it better than the logic of FS.
What I've learned while working on this project:
-localStorage
    -getItem()
    -setItem()
-Call back function
-JSON.parse()
-JSON.strigify()
-Filter method

The biggest problem I ran into was working with FS. I couldn't get my app to post/fetch JSON data. I had an idea on how to display the JSON data with `` template but the logic of FS just didn't make sense to me. 
Working with localStorage was much easier and I was able to complete my project within 1 day. 
My next goal is to create the same App using FS.
